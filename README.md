# Vocabulary-Sender
Send daily email with new words to learn in a foreign language 

This program uses smtplib to connect to email server and send my student an email with 2 words to learn for the day.

I use it with crontab so that it automatcally sends the email daily and will use it for my own learning as well.

- as some parts of code were used from this tutorial. It's a great site!

For future, I am planning to use Google docs API so that I can scrape a document that is constantly updated (when I teach my students) as my source of vocabulary.
